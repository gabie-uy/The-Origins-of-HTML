# The Origins of HTML

 All my notes, resources, and the activities I made to learn HTML from Cod√©dex

## Elements - elemental.html

An ``element`` usually consists of an opening tag, the content, and a closing tag. A tag is enclosed in angle brackets.

    <p>Hello World!</p>

The ``<p>`` paragraph element tells the browser that the content inside is "paragraph" text.

The ``<body>`` element defines an HTML document's "body" and it's where any content that we want to display to the user will be held:

    <body> opening tag begins the "body".
    <p>üëã I'm a new web developer!</p> is some text in a paragraph element.
    </body> closing tag ends the "body".

***There can only be one ``<body>`` element in an HTML file.***

**TWO SPACES** is recommended for indentations.

## Heading - newspaper.html

Suppose we want to add a headline to our website that displays a news article. Here's how we would do it using a ``<h1>`` heading element and a ``<p>`` paragraph element.

There are six levels of section headings, from ``<h1>`` to ``<h6>``

***Note: Only one ``<h1>`` element should be used in a .html file.***

## Line Break

Pressing enter won't do us any good because HTML ignores multiple spaces and line breaks within elements.

Line break is ``<br>``

A self-closing tag doesn't need to be closed manually by a closing tag (i.e., it does not have a separate closing ``</tag>``). The break tag is the first one we have encountered.

## Text Formatting - corporate.html

- ``<b>`` element to bold text.
- ``<i>`` element to italicize text.
- ``<u>`` element to underline text.
- ``<s>`` element to strikethrough text.

    <b>This text is using bold formatting.</b><br>
    <i>This text is using italics formatting.</i><br>
    <u>This text is using underline formatting.</u><br>
    <s>This text is using strikethrough formatting.</s><br>

***Note: The ``<b>`` element is just for bolding text stylistically; HTML also has a ``<strong>`` element used to convey that the content inside is important, as well as styling it to be bold.***

## Lists - chef.html

**Two types of HTML lists:**

1. ``<ul>`` Unordered lists - Known as bullet points
2. ``<ol>`` Ordered lists - Known as numbered lists

``li`` means list items that is used for both types

## Links - pet.html

``<a>`` anchor element! This link tag allows us to add a hyperlink to a piece of text. Let's see how we can do this:

    <a href="https://archive.org/web">Internet Archive</a>

An ``href``, or **hyperlink reference**, is a reference or pointer to another website that is linked in our HTML. When the text ‚ÄúInternet Archive‚Äù is clicked, the HTML will redirect to that site, which in our case, is https://archive.org/web

***Note: This can also be used to point to an email or phone number using a ``mailto:``, ``tel:``, or ``sms:`` parameter, respectively.***

## Images

- The ``<img>`` image element is another self-closing tag, so it doesn't have a closing tag.
- ``src`` attribute, which stands for ‚Äúsource‚Äù, specifies the file path of the image.
- ``"https://i.redd.it/5unn16axx1v81.jpg"`` is the image path.

## HTML Structure - blueprint.html

### MUST-HAVES

``<!DOCTYPE html>`` is the document type declaration that appears at the top of a .html file and tells the browser that our file is written in HTML5. This is used with a ``<html>`` element containing all the code processed on the page.

*Notice how the ``<!DOCTYPE html>`` doesn‚Äôt have a closing tag, while ``<html>`` does.*

***Note: All HTML files must start with a ``<!DOCTYPE html>`` declaration and the ``<html>`` element.***

**Inside ``<html>``, there should be two elements:**

``<head>``: This contains all the info for your browser that's not visible on the page.

``<body>``: This contains all of the content that you will end up seeing on the page.
The ``<title>`` element goes in the ``<head>`` and assigns text to the tab in our browser.

     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
       <head>
         <title>Cod√©dex | Start your coding adventure ‚ãÜÀô‚ü°</title>
       </head>
       <body>
         Code goes here
       </body>
     </html>

## Parents & Children - family_tree.html

Most individual elements can be parents with one or more child elements.

Here are some relationships:

- ``<head>`` and ``<body>`` are children of ``<html>``.
- ``<title>`` is the child of ``<head>``.
- ``<i>`` is child of ``<p>`` and grandkid of ``<body>``.

Elements can also be **siblings** if they share a direct parent element. Take this unordered list, for instance:

    <body>
      <ul>
        <li>üçÑ Mario</li>
        <li>üê¢ Luigi</li>
      </ul>
    </body>

The two ``<li>`` elements are siblings because both are children of the same parent, the ``<ul>`` element.

## Comments - craigslists.html

Everything surrounded by the ``<!--`` and ``-->`` comment markers is ignored and not rendered on the browser:

    <!-- I am a comment. -->
    <p>And I'm not a comment!</p>

## In-Line vs. Multi-line''

### In-Line

    <p>This text is visible. <!-- But this is not. --></p>

### *Multi-Line**

    <!--
      This is also a comment.
    -->

## Attributes - wiki_article.html

**Attributes** are additional settings that we can use to customize an element.

They are usually name/value pairs, like ``name="value"``, where the name and value are separated by an equals sign:

    <element name="value">Content</element>

The ``name`` indicates the attribute we are setting for our element.
The ``"value"`` for our attribute is surrounded by ``"`` double quotes.

If we want to use **lowercase letters** instead:

    <ol type="a">
      <li>Power ‚ö°</li>
      <li>Courage üî•</li>
      <li>Wisdom ü¶â</li>
    </ol>

Or, if want to use **Roman numerals**:

    <ol type="i">
      <li>Power ‚ö°</li>
      <li>Courage üî•</li>
      <li>Wisdom ü¶â</li>
    </ol>

For uppercase list item types for letters and Roman numerals, use type="A" and type="I", respectively.

### Attributes in ``<img>``

    <img alt="8-bit sprite of person using a laptop" src="https://www.codedex.io/images/tier1.png">

- The ``<img>`` element uses the ``src`` attribute to specify the file path of an image.
- The ``alt`` text is displayed instead! This allows assistive devices to read our text and describe the image.

### Attributes in ``<a>``

    <a href="https://www.codedex.io/">Cod√©dex.io</a>
    <a href="https://www.codedex.io/" target="_blank">Cod√©dex.io</a>

- The ``href`` attribute is where we add a URL that can be visited when the hyperlinked text is clicked.
- We can also use the ``target`` attribute and set it to ``"_blank"`` to visit the URL on a separate tab on our browser:

## Classes and IDs - lorem_ipsum.html

``class`` and ``id`` are used for **labeling** elements.

An element can be assigned multiple class values in the form of a **space-separated list**:

    <p class="first-value second-value third-value">Hello, World</p>

Each element can only have one ``id`` value with no spaces. Every ``id`` value should be unique in the entire page:

    <p id="value">Hello, World</p>

Additionally, ``id`` can be *used to link to another part of the same page*, such as the heading! This can be matched with an ``<a>`` anchor element's ``href`` attribute via a ``#`` hashtag symbol, followed by the identifier used for the ``id``:

    <a href="#medellin">Link to Medell√≠n</a>
    
    <h2 class="city" id="medellin">Medell√≠n üá®üá¥</h2>

Lastly, where only one ``id`` can be assigned to a single element, a ``class`` can be assigned to many:

    <h2 class="city" id="medellin">Medell√≠n üá®üá¥</h2>
    <h2 class="city" id="libson">Lisbon üáµüáπ</h2>
    <h2 class="city" id="bali">Bali üáÆüá©</h2>

The values for the ``class`` and ``id`` attributes must always be lowercase. If their name is made of multiple words, they should be separated by dashes ``-``

***Note: A good way to remember class vs id is... there can be multiple students in a class, but each student should have an unique id. üí°***

## Division

``<div>`` is a way to create sections for a page

The ``<div>`` element is kind of like a generic container with no particular meaning. This element and the ``class`` and ``id`` attributes can go hand in hand.

The ``<div>`` element is used to group content and be labeled by the ``class`` and ``id`` attributes.

    <div class="page-section" id="about-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Ness is an aspiring web developer!</p>
      </div>
      
    <div class="page-section" id="social-media">
      <h2>Social:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>GitHub</li>
          <li>Twitter</li>
          <li>LinkedIn</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

## Style Attribute

We can apply a ``style`` attribute to any HTML element to stylize certain aspects of that element, such as what color the text should be:

    <p>
      Roses are <span style="color:red;">red</span>.<br />
      Violets are <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>.
    </p>

This attribute uses a *special syntax* where a style is made of a property (i.e., color) and a value (red), separated by a  ``:`` colon. Multiple styles can be applied to a single element, but they must be separated by a ``;`` semi-colon.

    <p>
      Roses are <span style="color:red; text-decoration:underline;">red</span>.<br />
      Violets are <span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">blue</span>.
    </p>

Alternatively, the ``<style>`` element can be used in the ``<head>`` to style our elements in the ``<body>``.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <style>
          ... Styles for elements go here
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        ... Elements go here
      </body>
    </html>

Elements can be selected inside the ``<style>`` element using curly braces ({ }):

    <style>
      element {
        property: value;
      }
    </style>

Using it with class ``.`` and id ``#``:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <style>
          span {
            text-decoration: underline;
          }

          #red-word {
            color: red;
          }

          #blue-word {
            color: blue;
          }
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>
          Roses are <span id="red-word">red</span>.<br />
          Violets are <span id="blue-word">blue</span>.<br />
        </p>
      </body>
    </html>

## Google Forms

In HTML:

    <form action="" method="">
      <!-- More code will go here -->
    </form>

Two attributes are commonly used with the ``<form>`` element:

- The ``action`` attribute that says where the form data should go after it is submitted.
- The ``method`` attribute for how the form data is processed.

## Inputs

The ``<input>`` element as an interactive control for entering data. A type attribute is used to determine the kind of input to use. While there are many types of inputs, the two we'll use most often are:

A text value that renders a plain textbox on the form.

    <form>
      <input type="text">
    </form>

A submit value that turns the ``<input>`` element into a button for submitting the form data.

    <form>
      <input type="submit">
    </form>

Note: The ``<input>`` element uses a self-closing tag.

Example:
<form>
  <input type="text">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

## Sign Up

### Input Type: Emails

``<input type="email">``

This tells the form to expect a text input with the typical email syntax (including the @ symbol).

### Input Type: Passwords

``<input type="password">``

Dots will replace the text that would otherwise appear in the text box:
