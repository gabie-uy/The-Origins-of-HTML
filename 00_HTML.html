<h2>July 10, 2024</h2>
<p>I wish to be able to work in New York City with a career in cybersecurity. I wish to accomplish a lot of technical milestones like certifications, knowing programming languages, etc. I wish for a good relationship, and a cat for a companion. I also wish to never give up on anything, and think straight with purpose.</p>
